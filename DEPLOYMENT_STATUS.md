# Deployment Status - Mediabox Admin Customizations

## Current Situation

The patch-admin.js script has been fully implemented with all Mediabox customizations:
- ✅ Welcome text changed to "Welcome to The Mediabox Global Ecommerce Store Admin Portal"
- ✅ Logo replacement logic for login and reset password pages
- ✅ Header logo replacement
- ✅ Color scheme application (#df3d58, #d74e2f)
- ✅ Favicon replacement
- ✅ Global CSS injection for comprehensive branding

## Build Process Configuration

1. **Main package.json** - Updated to run patch after build:
   ```json
   "build": "medusa build && node patch-admin.js"
   ```

2. **Admin deployment** - Uses the unified build command:
   - Digital Ocean build command: `yarn build`
   - This automatically runs the patch script

## Why Customizations Aren't Showing Yet

The deployed admin panel (https://shop.mediabox.co/app) is still showing the default Medusa branding because:

1. **Deployment hasn't been triggered** - The changes need to be pushed to trigger a new deployment
2. **Build cache** - Digital Ocean might be using cached build artifacts

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push changes** to trigger deployment:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Enable Mediabox branding customizations"
   git push
   ```

2. **Monitor deployment** in Digital Ocean dashboard

3. **Clear cache if needed** - If customizations don't appear after deployment:
   - Force rebuild in Digital Ocean
   - Clear browser cache when viewing the admin panel

## Verification

Once deployed, the admin panel should show:
- Mediabox logo instead of Medusa logo
- Custom welcome text
- Mediabox color scheme (pink/red theme)
- Custom favicon

## Local Testing

To test locally before deployment:
```bash
cd medusa-server
yarn build
# Check .medusa/server/public/admin/index.html for changes
# Or run locally and check http://localhost:9000/app
