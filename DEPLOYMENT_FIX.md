# Mediabox Admin Customization Deployment Fix

## Problem
The Mediabox branding and logo changes were not appearing on the deployed admin panel, even though the deployment was successful.

## Root Cause
The issue was that the patch script was only updating the node_modules files, but not the actual built admin files that get deployed. The admin panel is built into the `.medusa/server/public/admin` directory, and these files need to be patched as well.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Patch Script
The `patch-admin.js` script has been updated to:
- Handle both node_modules and built admin files
- Inject CSS directly into the login page for logo replacement
- Update the index.html file in the built admin directory with global styles
- Use base64 encoded images to ensure logos work in production

### 2. Updated Build Process
The `build-admin.sh` script now:
1. Temporarily enables the admin panel for building
2. Builds the admin panel
3. **Runs the patch script to apply customizations**
4. Restores the configuration

### 3. Key Files

#### patch-admin.js
- Searches for and replaces "Welcome to Medusa" text
- Injects custom logo into login page using CSS
- Updates reset password page logo
- Applies Mediabox color scheme
- Updates index.html with global styles

#### build-admin.sh
```bash
# Build admin
yarn install
npx medusa build

# Apply Mediabox branding customizations
echo "Applying Mediabox branding customizations..."
node patch-admin.js
```

### 4. Testing Locally
To test the customizations locally:
```bash
cd medusa-server
./build-admin.sh
# The customized admin files will be in .medusa/server/public/admin
```

### 5. Deployment
The admin deployment process remains the same, but now includes the customizations:
1. Run `./build-admin.sh` to build and customize the admin
2. Deploy the contents of `.medusa/server/public/admin` to your static hosting service

## Customizations Applied

1. **Welcome Text**: "Welcome to Medusa" → "Welcome to The Mediabox Global Ecommerce Store Admin Portal"
2. **Login Logo**: Mediabox logo displayed on login page
3. **Header Logo**: Mediabox logo in the admin header
4. **Color Scheme**: Mediabox red (#df3d58) applied to buttons and interactive elements
5. **Favicon**: Custom Mediabox favicon

## Troubleshooting

If customizations don't appear:
1. Run `./debug-admin-customizations.sh` to check what was applied
2. Clear browser cache and hard refresh
3. Check the browser console for any errors
4. Verify the patch script ran successfully during build
