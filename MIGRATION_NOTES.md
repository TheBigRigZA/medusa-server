# Migration Notes - Dashboard Customization Setup

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Patch Script Framework
- Added `patch-admin.js` with helper functions from Igor Khomenko's article
- Script is ready for customizations but currently has no active modifications
- All example customizations are commented out for reference

### 2. Updated Build Process
- Modified `admin-deployment/package.json` to include postinstall script
- Updated `admin-deployment/.do-app-spec.yaml` to run patch script during build
- Build command now: builds → patches → deploys

### 3. Created Documentation
- **Server README**: Complete documentation for the API server
  - Includes baseline commit hash
  - Supabase configuration details
  - CORS setup information
  - Deployment instructions
  
- **Admin README**: Comprehensive guide for dashboard customization
  - Explains patch script methodology
  - Provides examples from the article
  - Includes troubleshooting guide
  - References original article

## Current State
- ✅ Framework is in place
- ✅ No visual changes (patch script runs but doesn't modify anything)
- ✅ Deployment process remains functional
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive

## Next Steps

To add customizations:
1. Edit `patch-admin.js`
2. Uncomment desired examples or add new ones
3. Test locally with:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   npx medusa build
   node patch-admin.js
   ```
4. Commit and push to trigger deployment
