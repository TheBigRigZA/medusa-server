# Build Process Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Main Build Process
- **File**: `medusa-server/package.json`
- **Change**: Modified the build script to run patch-admin.js after Medusa build completes
- **New Command**: `"build": "medusa build && node patch-admin.js"`

### 2. Simplified Admin Deployment Build
- **File**: `medusa-server/admin-deployment/.do-app-spec.yaml`
- **Change**: Updated to use `yarn build` instead of calling `npx medusa build` and `node patch-admin.js` separately
- **New Command**: Uses `yarn build` which now includes the patch script

### 3. Cleaned Up Admin Package.json
- **File**: `medusa-server/admin-deployment/package.json`
- **Change**: 
  - Removed the `postinstall` script (no longer needed)
  - Updated build command to use `yarn build` for consistency

## Build Flow

The build process now works as follows:

1. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   yarn build  # Builds Medusa and applies customizations
   ```

2. **Digital Ocean Deployment**:
   - Runs `yarn install`
   - Runs `yarn build` (which includes patch-admin.js)
   - Copies admin files to dist directory

## Benefits

- **Simpler**: One command handles both build and customization
- **Consistent**: Same process for local and deployment
- **Maintainable**: Patch script runs at the right time automatically
- **No Breaking Changes**: Deployment continues to work as before

## Testing

To test the changes locally:
```bash
cd medusa-server
yarn build
# Check .medusa/admin for customizations
```

The patch-admin.js will run automatically after the Medusa build completes.
