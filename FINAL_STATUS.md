# Final Status - Mediabox Admin Customizations

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

All necessary changes have been implemented and committed:

### 1. **Patch Script** (`patch-admin.js`)
- Fully implemented with all Mediabox customizations
- Changes welcome text to "Welcome to The Mediabox Global Ecommerce Store Admin Portal"
- Replaces Medusa logos with Mediabox logos
- Applies Mediabox color scheme (#df3d58, #d74e2f)
- Updates favicon
- Injects global CSS for comprehensive branding

### 2. **Build Process**
- `package.json`: Updated to run patch script after build
  ```json
  "build": "medusa build && node patch-admin.js"
  ```
- `.do-app-spec.yaml`: Uses `yarn build` which includes patch script
- `admin-deployment/package.json`: Cleaned up to use unified build

### 3. **Assets**
All logo assets are in place:
- `assets/logo-login.png`
- `assets/logo-header.png`
- `assets/favicon.ico`

## üöÄ Deployment Status

**Current State**: The live admin panel (https://shop.mediabox.co/app) still shows default Medusa branding.

**Reason**: The Digital Ocean deployment needs to run with the updated build process.

## üìã What Happens Next

1. **Digital Ocean will automatically deploy** when it detects changes in the repository
2. **The build process will**:
   - Install dependencies
   - Build Medusa (including admin)
   - Run patch-admin.js to apply customizations
   - Deploy the customized admin panel

## üîç How to Verify Deployment

1. **Check Digital Ocean App Platform** dashboard for deployment status
2. **Once deployed**, visit https://shop.mediabox.co/app
3. **You should see**:
   - Mediabox logo instead of Medusa logo
   - "Welcome to The Mediabox Global Ecommerce Store Admin Portal"
   - Pink/red color scheme throughout
   - Mediabox favicon in browser tab

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If customizations don't appear after deployment:

1. **Force rebuild in Digital Ocean**:
   - Go to App Platform dashboard
   - Click "Force Rebuild & Deploy"

2. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Or open in incognito/private window

3. **Check build logs** in Digital Ocean for any errors

## üìù Summary

Everything is properly configured and committed. The customizations will appear once Digital Ocean runs the deployment with the updated build process. No further code changes are needed.
